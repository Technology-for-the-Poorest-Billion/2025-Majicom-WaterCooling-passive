# Evaporative Cooling T2 Methodology and Testing
**Summary:** My role focuses on designing, building, and testing an evaporative cooling system for Majicom's solar-powered water purification kiosk. The aim is to keep purified water cool post-filtration, particularly in hot off grid environments like Tanzania, where both energy and material resources are limited.

I have selected sustainable materials, designing the experimental setup, and building a testing framework to compare passive and fan-assisted evaporative cooling performance. Iâ€™ve also developed a detailed **risk assessment** to ensure safety throughout testing.

While T1 is exploring a **heat pump-based system**, our work focuses on an **assisted passive cooling solution** that avoids high power demands. This approach could operate independently or in parallel with active systems, offering a more affordable and energy-efficient alternative.

## Experimental Method

### Prepare Materials
- Cut each fabric sample to the same size and thickness (e.g. A4)
- Pre-soak all samples in water for 5 minutes
- Lightly wring and weigh each sample before wrapping (optional)

### Bottle Setup
- Use 6 identical 1L bottles filled with room-temperature water
- Wrap each bottle tightly with one fabric type (ensuring same thickness)
- Secure fabric with elastic bands or tape for consistent contact

### Assign Airflow
- Place 3 bottles under fans with variable speeds (~15â€“20 cm away), inside a bucket or enclosed container to control airflow
- Leave 3 bottles as control samples with no fan
- Ensure all bottles are in the same environment (same bench, lighting, etc.)

### Record Starting Temperature
- Use a basic thermometer to measure starting water temperature in each bottle
- Ensure consistent timing and measurement across samples

###  Begin Test
- Run experiment for approx. 3 hours
- Re-wet fabrics halfway through if needed (record time and water amount)
- Note general environmental conditions (approx. room temp, airflow)

### Record Final Data
- Measure final water temperature for each bottle using the same thermometer
- Optionally weigh each fabric again to estimate evaporated water mass

## What to Analyse

- **Cooling performance**: Which combinations gave the biggest temperature drop?
- **Fan effectiveness**: Did the fan significantly improve cooling across all materials?
- **Water usage**: Which materials lost the most water (if weighing)?
- **Practicality**: Which materials stayed wet the longest, dried too quickly, or were easiest to handle?

---

## Final Output

From this test, we will determine:
- The most effective material + airflow pairing
- Whether including a fan or multiple fans is worth the extra energy
- Realistic estimates of water use and cooling potential in a kiosk setting
