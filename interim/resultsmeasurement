# Assumptions
- simple 1D model
- uniform thermal conductivity across temperature range (change too small so neglegible)
- known q from evaporation
- known thermal conductivity of container

## Test data to be measured:
1. ambient temperature in evaporation chamber
2. temperature of water at the wall of container
3. thicknesses

note: preferrably measure the temperatue closer to top of water level

### Calculation of useful data
Would be useful to find out
1. outlet temperature
2. average temperature in tank

Could model as simple 1D heat transfer with known Q due to evaporation. It is expected that due to the small margin of temperature, it may be possible to simplify the model further and assume uniform temperature distribution in water.

Convection inside tank considered:

 - seems that substantial is needed to show difference between height of measurement taken

Low rate of change in temperature so will not be significant?

top of water preferred


Useful measurements
outlet temperature
average temperature 


measuring external ambient temp too?

try taking at edge of inner cylinder first and then see if there is significant effect?
