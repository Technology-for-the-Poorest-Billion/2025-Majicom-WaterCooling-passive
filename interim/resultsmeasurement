# Assumptions

- simple 1D model
- uniform thermal conductivity across temperature range (change too small so neglegible)
- known q from evaporation
- known thermal conductivity of container

## Test data to be measured:

1. ambient temperature in evaporation chamber
2. temperature of water at the wall of container
3. thicknesses

note: preferrably measure the temperatue closer to top of water level

### Calculation of useful data

Would be useful to find out
1. outlet temperature
2. average temperature in tank

Could model as simple 1D heat transfer with known Q due to evaporation. It is expected that due to the small margin of temperature, it may be possible to simplify the model further and assume uniform temperature distribution in water.
