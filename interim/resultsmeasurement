Assumptions
simple 1D model
uniform thermal conductivity across temperature range (change too small so neglegible)
known q from evaporation
known thermal conductivity of container

Convection inside tank considered:

 - seems that substantial is needed to show difference between height of measurement taken

Low rate of change in temperature so will not be significant?

top of water preferred


Useful measurements
outlet temperature
average temperature 


measuring external ambient temp too?

try taking at edge of inner cylinder first and then see if there is significant effect?
