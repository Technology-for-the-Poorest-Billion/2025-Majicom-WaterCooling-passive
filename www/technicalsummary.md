## Numerical Model 

The first aspect of our project was to code a virtual simulation of the Majicom Kiosk. The aim of this code was to predict how the water would behave as the environment or the design of the kiosk was changed and evolved. As the code was produced we found that we could also use this to try and replicate the experimental results by treating it as a scaled down version of the kiosk. The full annotated code can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D8jrgBWuxRUjkXFdTaMW2er6YYpis4Rj?authuser=1#scrollTo=mpWEDmWmkx8X)

We used a simple heat exchange model shown below to understand all of the different sources of energy in and out of the water: Heat from the air, radiation from the tank walls and energy taken away by the evaporative cooling. These all have a complex interplay that are affected by the design of the rest of the tank. Being able to test how changing the tank quickly through this model makes it much faster to test different cooling jackets, and helped to provide some early insight into our ideas.
