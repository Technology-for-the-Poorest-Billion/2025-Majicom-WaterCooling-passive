## Aim 

Our aim for this experiment was to see how different fabric jackets affecting the efficiency of evaporative cooling. Additionally, we were interested to see whether the material thickness or the placement of the fans had any major impact on the quality of cooling. 

## Experiment set-up

The entire setup was built from scratch with the aim of mimicking Majicom’s use case as closely as possible. All components were chosen to be cheap, accessible, and adaptable in lower-resource environments - while still giving meaningful and consistent data. We used 1L plastic bottles filled with 500 mL of tap water cooled to around 15°C. This was based on two key things: (1) 15°C is close to the groundwater or municipal supply temperatures expected in Tanzania, and (2) it gives enough of a starting point to track how effective each fabric is at keeping water cool over time.

The bottle in each setup was suspended inside a bucket (that mimicked the kiosk outer shell) with a fan inside that pushed air over the surface of the fabric. The fabric was soaked, wrung and allowed to partially dry to prevent any dripping or other electrical safety hazards. Our fabric selection was based on commonly available fabrics, with an interest in being able to locally source the fabric that we selected

We tested three main fan positions: Fan underneath the bottle, fan above the bottle, and two fans blowing on the sides of the bottle (one fan drawing air into the tank and the other pushing air out). These each provided unique cooling characteristics that affect both the water temperature and the drying times

## Results

Data was recorded at 5 minute intervals and collated into plots like the ones seen above. These allowed us to clearly identify trends in behaviour between different materials and configurations. Here, for example, we can see cleary that cotton is able to achieve significantly more effective cooling than the other fabrics tested in this example. 

Our investigation involved testing across a broad range of materials, fan speeds and configurations to narrow down and identify what the optimal design for the real world kiosk would be. 

## Recommendations

- **Best All-Round Setup:** Bottom fan, 12V, Cotton wrap
- **Most Efficient Low-Energy Setup:** Bottom fan, 9V, Jute
- **For Sustained Cooling:** Linen with side fans at 12V, or combined wrap
- **Innovation Opportunity:** Dual-layer wraps (cotton outside, jute inside) or wick-fed fabric reservoirs
- **Testing Extension:** Include fan pulsing and material rehydration cycles to simulate real use
