### Scope of Work

Our project is broken into two main components: experimental and numerical modelling.



### The Team

Oishi - Bio & Mechanical Engineering Student. Main Focus: Experimental Design & Data Collection
Timothy - Mechanical & Aero Engineering Student: Data Collection & Results Analysis 
Alex - Mechanical & Aero Engineering Student: Numerical Modelling 

### Teamwork Strategy

1. **Core Task Identification**: Ensuring that the team had clearly defined core objectives that we focused on working on as a collective
2. **Cross-Task Communicaton**: Establishing and using communication means even when dividing the project to ensure that the modelling and experimental work remains aligned
3. **Meeting with Majicom**: Having weekly meetings with the team at Majicom to keep them updated on our progress and identify what data and information would be most valuable to them
4. **Allocation of tasks**: Ensuring our collective workload is maintained to a manageable level by having a flexible allocation of tasks that allowed people to shift focus to where was most urgent
5. **Live Documentation**: Maintaining a live documentation of our work to make it easier for collaboration

### What Worked
- **Clear Role Assignments**: The workload was balanced and clear throughout the project, allowing for a healthy workload distribution 
- **Group Cohesion**: Thanks to open communication, the project remained cohesive, with different parts working well together 
- **Majicom Feedback**: Working closely with Majicom meant that we could tailor our data collection to what would be most useful for them
- 

### What Didn't Work
- **Technical Difficulties and T**: We underestimated the complexity of our primary objectives. This caused delays and resulted in the inability to implement local calendar syncing. After identifying that we may be behind schedule due to the unexpected amount of bugs and issues that required solving, we communicated and decided to take the divide-and-conquer approach where one teammate moves on to the next independent task (e.g. presentation/website) when the others are debugging. This conserves time and enables us to generate a well-functioning deliverable despite one incomplete objective.

### Constructive Recommendations
1. **Maintain Time Management and Update Plans**: Regularly update the project plan to reflect current progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.
2. **Foster Good Communication**: Continue to promote open and effective communication among team members to address issues promptly.
3. **Avoid Last-Minute Rush**: Aim to complete tasks ahead of the deadline to allow time for unforeseen challenges.
4. **Reassess and Reprioritize**: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize tasks to ensure that core features are completed on time.
