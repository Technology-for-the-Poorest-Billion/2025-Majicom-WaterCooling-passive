title: Project Management

### Teamwork Strategy
1. **Ensure Communication**: Establish clear and consistent communication channels to facilitate information sharing and collaboration.
2. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule frequent meetings to discuss progress, address issues, and make decisions collectively.
3. **Effective Time Management and Planning**: Assign specific tasks to team members according to their strengths and ensure tasks are completed at different stages to maintain workflow.
4. **Seek Help When Necessary**: Encourage team members to seek assistance when encountering difficulties, fostering a supportive environment.
5. **Active Team Work Sessions**: Working in the same room together most days we worked on the project so that we could help each other out.
6. **Prioritize Primary Tasks**: The original objectives were put into order of importance when focussing on the wider impact. This helped with time management.
7. **Effective Collaboration**: Understanding how individual strengths can be paired with tasks.

Most planned milestones were achieved as outlined in the plan. We completed 4 out of 5 main objectives, with the third objective left for future work.

1. **Cycle Prediction Based on User Input**
2. **Prediction Visualization on a Calendar**
3. **Syncing with Local Calendar** *(Future Work)*
4. **Local Data Storage**
5. **User Customization of the Webpage and Calendar** (appearance, notes, emojis, etc.)

### What Worked
- **Clear Role Assignments**: Each team member was responsible for specific tasks, ensuring a balanced distribution of work.
- **Successful Integration**: We effectively integrated the contributions of all team members, resulting in a cohesive final product.
- **Clear Communication**: We helped each other out if we were struggling with tasks and were a good team that worked well together. We had our strengths
and we used them to our advantage while also learning new skills along the way. We also have our respective weaknesses and all kept an open mind toward suggestions.

### What Didn't Work
- **Technical Difficulties and T**: We underestimated the complexity of our primary objectives. This caused delays and resulted in the inability to implement local calendar syncing. After identifying that we may be behind schedule due to the unexpected amount of bugs and issues that required solving, we communicated and decided to take the divide-and-conquer approach where one teammate moves on to the next independent task (e.g. presentation/website) when the others are debugging. This conserves time and enables us to generate a well-functioning deliverable despite one incomplete objective.

### Constructive Recommendations
1. **Maintain Time Management and Update Plans**: Regularly update the project plan to reflect current progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.
2. **Foster Good Communication**: Continue to promote open and effective communication among team members to address issues promptly.
3. **Avoid Last-Minute Rush**: Aim to complete tasks ahead of the deadline to allow time for unforeseen challenges.
4. **Reassess and Reprioritize**: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize tasks to ensure that core features are completed on time.
