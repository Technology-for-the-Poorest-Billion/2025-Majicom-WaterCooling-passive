### Scope of Work

Our project is broken into two main components: experimental and numerical modelling.



### The Team

Oishi - Bio & Mechanical Engineering Student. Main Focus: Experimental Design & Data Collection
Timothy - Mechanical & Aero Engineering Student: Data Collection & Results Analysis 
Alex - Mechanical & Aero Engineering Student: Numerical Modelling 

### Teamwork Strategy

1. **Core Task Identification**: Ensuring that the team had clearly defined core objectives that we focused on working on as a collective
2. **Cross-Task Communicaton**: Establishing and using communication means even when dividing the project to ensure that the modelling and experimental work remains aligned
3. **Meeting with Majicom**: Having weekly meetings with the team at Majicom to keep them updated on our progress and identify what data and information would be most valuable to them
4. **Allocation of tasks**: Ensuring our collective workload is maintained to a manageable level by having a flexible allocation of tasks that allowed people to shift focus to where was most urgent
5. **Live Documentation**: Maintaining a live documentation of our work to make it easier for collaboration

### What Worked
- **Clear Role Assignments**: The workload was balanced and clear throughout the project, allowing for a healthy workload distribution 
- **Group Cohesion**: Thanks to open communication, the project remained cohesive, with different parts working well together 
- **Majicom Feedback**: Working closely with Majicom with weekly meetings meant that we could tailor our data collection to what would be most useful for them
- 

### What Didn't Work

- **Project Scope**: This project had massive potential for a large scale undertaking of redesigning the kiosk entirely to implement multiple different passive cooling technologies. We very quickly found after our initial discussion and proposal that the bredth of our ideas were impractical to achieve within the tight time constraints. This created an additional challenge of working of what we could practically deliver to best inform the team's future design work
- **Purchasing Delays**: There were a number of technical delays regarding purchasing that set us back initially, however we were able to obtain the required apparatus and material for our experimental work despite that
