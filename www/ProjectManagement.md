### Scope of Work

Our project is broken into two main components: experimental and numerical modelling.

### Teamwork Strategy

1. **Core Task Identification**: Ensuring that the team had clearly defined core objectives that we focused on working on as a collective
2. **Cross-Task Communicaton**: Establishing and using communication means even when dividing the project to ensure that the modelling and experimental work remains aligned
3. **Meeting with Majicom**: Having weekly meetings with the team at Majicom to keep them updated on our progress and identify what data and information would be most valuable to them
4. **Allocation of tasks**: Ensuring our collective workload is maintained to a manageable level by having a flexible allocation of tasks that allowed people to shift focus to where was most urgent
5. **Live Documentation**: Maintaining a live documentation of our work to make it easier for collaboration
   

### Timeline

We managed to successfully follow this workflow for the most part, with some small variations for contingency where project purchasing waas delayed or work took longer than initially anticipated

1. **Cycle Prediction Based on User Input**
2. **Prediction Visualization on a Calendar**
3. **Syncing with Local Calendar** *(Future Work)*
4. **Local Data Storage**
5. **User Customization of the Webpage and Calendar** (appearance, notes, emojis, etc.)

### What Worked
- **Clear Role Assignments**: Each team member was responsible for specific tasks, ensuring a balanced distribution of work.
- **Successful Integration**: We effectively integrated the contributions of all team members, resulting in a cohesive final product.
- **Clear Communication**: We helped each other out if we were struggling with tasks and were a good team that worked well together. We had our strengths
and we used them to our advantage while also learning new skills along the way. We also have our respective weaknesses and all kept an open mind toward suggestions.

### What Didn't Work
- **Technical Difficulties and T**: We underestimated the complexity of our primary objectives. This caused delays and resulted in the inability to implement local calendar syncing. After identifying that we may be behind schedule due to the unexpected amount of bugs and issues that required solving, we communicated and decided to take the divide-and-conquer approach where one teammate moves on to the next independent task (e.g. presentation/website) when the others are debugging. This conserves time and enables us to generate a well-functioning deliverable despite one incomplete objective.

### Constructive Recommendations
1. **Maintain Time Management and Update Plans**: Regularly update the project plan to reflect current progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.
2. **Foster Good Communication**: Continue to promote open and effective communication among team members to address issues promptly.
3. **Avoid Last-Minute Rush**: Aim to complete tasks ahead of the deadline to allow time for unforeseen challenges.
4. **Reassess and Reprioritize**: If delays occur, reassess the timeline and prioritize tasks to ensure that core features are completed on time.
