title: Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
---

üåè UNICEF proposed 17 sustainable development goals which act as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. A further 9 principles were proposed for the implementation of technology-enabled programs. Being at a junction of development when extreme weather is becoming more frequent and conflicts more intense, engineers must use these goals as guidance to achieve sustainable development and preserve a future for posterity. <br />

## Sustainable Development Goals

1. Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in.  <br />
2. Investments in infrastructure are crucial to achieving sustainable development. <br />
3. Responsible Production and Consumption <br />
<br />

Working with our partner Majicom, the most important goal is to ensure that the water delivered is clean. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that our passive cooling solution would not lead to an increased risk of water contamination, such that any alterations to the enclosed clean water delivery is not made. Since evaporation cooling uses water for cooling purposes, the efficiency of rate of water evaporation to temperature drop achieved is also investigated to ensure that the use of water is as efficient as possible.<br />
<br />
Improvement in infrastructure is also addressed. With the inclusion of our cooling system, we are improving the quality of the end products from the water dispensers. Yet, it would be key to ensure that the cooling solution is resilient to the operating environments and durable. Inclusive and sustainable industrialization is also aimed with considerations of increased elements of local assembly or even parts being manufactured locally for the cooling components.<br />
<br />
Sustainable consumptions is also promoted through our solution. With the use of the passive cooling soluion, the temperature drop of water could be achieved in an energy efficient means compared to refrigirating or other cooling methods, and would help further alleviate bottled water consumption as it allows for the water dispensers to be competitive with refrigirated bottled water. Cooling pad materials could also be recycled from waste clothes which help reduce waste production.<br />
