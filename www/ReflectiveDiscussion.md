title: Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
---

🌏 UNICEF proposed 17 sustainable development goals which act as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. A further 9 principles were proposed for the implementation of technology-enabled programs. Being at a junction of development when extreme weather is becoming more frequent and conflicts more intense, engineers must use these goals as guidance to achieve sustainable development and preserve a future for posterity. <br />

1. Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in.  <br />
2. Investments in infrastructure are crucial to achieving sustainable development. <br />
3. Responsible Production and Consumption <br />

Sustainable consumptions is also promoted through our solution. <br />

If the SDGs are viewed as targets that our solution attempts to achieve, then PDDs can be considered specific requirements for our outcome.
1. Design with people: Good design starts and ends with people that will manage, use, and ideally benefit from a given digital initiative.
2. stablish people-first data practices: People-first data practices prioritize transparency, consent ✏, and redressal while allowing people and communities to retain control of and derive value from their own data.
3. Use evidence to improve outcomes: Evidence drives impact: continually gather, analyze and use feedback 🙂😐🙁.

🫂 Design with people was practiced from the beginning when our parent company [IMMI](https://immiwatch.com/) conducted detailed market research and realized an urgent demand for a solution that raises awareness, reduces anxiety for the menstrual cycle and ensures data privacy. Statistics have shown that 40% of the girls in the US felt "confused and unprepared" for their first period and 79% of women showed concerns regarding negligence toward data privacy in existing tracker apps. During development, a significant proportion of our time was devoted to implementing a reliable and efficient storage method 🔐 (we chose IndexDB). We also ensured that the prediction algorithm uses only local data and does not export the data anywhere but the user's device. In the future, we expect the app to conduct public tests allowing users to validate our product before pushing it to market. <br />
<br />
🗃 Through careful data management, we also achieved the second principle. Existing trackers often require the user to provide their cycle length as part of the prediction which was proven unnecessary. Currently, our app only requires inputting the start date of the cycle 📆 for prediction, even when more powerful algorithms 🔢 are developed in the future, the additional data needed will be optional. <br />
<br />
💬 The last principle is anticipated to be satisfied in the future by our parent company. A feedback link has been planned to be added to the app as a passive measure of understanding the users. Moreover, active approaches such as interviewing and distributing surveys could also be used to gather more information to improve our product. <br />
