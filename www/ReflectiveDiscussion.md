title: Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
---

🌏 UNICEF has proposed 17 sustainable development goals that aim to avoid depleting resources at the expense of economic growth. Being at a junction of development when extreme weather is becoming more frequent and conflicts more intense, engineers must use these goals as guidance to achieve sustainable development and preserve a future for posterity. <br />

1. Good health and well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages." (including both physical and mental health) <br />
2. Gender equality: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." <br />
<br />

💪 Increasing education 📚 on periods amongst younger girls allows our cycle tracker app to improve physical well-being because improving understanding removes mystery and fear, as well as standardizes practices. Research has shown that in some developing countries, the needs of women during their periods are often neglected due to low education and limited income. In more extreme cases, having a period is considered taboo and should be concealed from the rest of the family. All of these are causes of poor menstrual hygiene and could lead to infections 💉 (e.g. urinary tract infection) and even affect one's ability to reproduce. Albeit an app will not increase one's income nor will it rectify those misconceptions immediately, it will be a concrete step towards an informed period, reducing the likelihood of illness, and gradually improving social status. <br />
<br />
❤ Mental well-being is another key component towards achieving "good health and well-being". Similar to the approach described above, by raising awareness of menstrual cycles, we expect to alleviate the internally originated sense of inferiority as well as reduce biases from others. On top of that, reliable cycle prediction ensures that periods can be anticipated, hence, mitigating stress regarding any potential embarrassments. Furthermore, we hope our app will create a sense of community among our users 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧, difficult times may not be so challenging when you are surrounded by your peers and friends. <br />
<br />
🟰 Gender equality is promoted through raising awareness as well. Our app not only empowers female users with reliable tracking but also grants their partners an opportunity to learn and care for their spouse on a single platform. From a broader point of view, gender-related biases include confirmation bias (selective perception 👁 of information to confirm one's theory), availability heuristics (belief based on the availability of information in one's mind), and more. These biases could be the result of culture, personality, and upbringing. Although some aspects, such as personality, are relatively hard to change, raising awareness on our cycle tracker removes barriers to information 🚧, exposing one to new perspectives, thus enabling the user to think more critically with more comprehensive knowledge, and achieving gender equality.<br />

If the SDGs are viewed as targets that our solution attempts to achieve, then PDDs can be considered specific requirements for our outcome.
1. Design with people: Good design starts and ends with people that will manage, use, and ideally benefit from a given digital initiative.
2. stablish people-first data practices: People-first data practices prioritize transparency, consent ✏, and redressal while allowing people and communities to retain control of and derive value from their own data.
3. Use evidence to improve outcomes: Evidence drives impact: continually gather, analyze and use feedback 🙂😐🙁.

🫂 Design with people was practiced from the beginning when our parent company [IMMI](https://immiwatch.com/) conducted detailed market research and realized an urgent demand for a solution that raises awareness, reduces anxiety for the menstrual cycle and ensures data privacy. Statistics have shown that 40% of the girls in the US felt "confused and unprepared" for their first period and 79% of women showed concerns regarding negligence toward data privacy in existing tracker apps. During development, a significant proportion of our time was devoted to implementing a reliable and efficient storage method 🔐 (we chose IndexDB). We also ensured that the prediction algorithm uses only local data and does not export the data anywhere but the user's device. In the future, we expect the app to conduct public tests allowing users to validate our product before pushing it to market. <br />
<br />
🗃 Through careful data management, we also achieved the second principle. Existing trackers often require the user to provide their cycle length as part of the prediction which was proven unnecessary. Currently, our app only requires inputting the start date of the cycle 📆 for prediction, even when more powerful algorithms 🔢 are developed in the future, the additional data needed will be optional. <br />
<br />
💬 The last principle is anticipated to be satisfied in the future by our parent company. A feedback link has been planned to be added to the app as a passive measure of understanding the users. Moreover, active approaches such as interviewing and distributing surveys could also be used to gather more information to improve our product. <br />
