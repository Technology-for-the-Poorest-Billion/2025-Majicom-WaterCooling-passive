## Sustainable Development Goals
UNICEF proposed 17 sustainable development goals which act as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, with inter-connected impacts on the environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development. 

[Majicom's website](https://www.majico.org/impact) identifies the five most relevant of the [United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).

Our work primarily contributes to the progress already made by Majicom and allows for further enhancements in the four most relavant goals that are highlighted below. <br />
<br />

## Goal 6: Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in

</p>
<br />
Working with our partner Majicom, the most important goal is to ensure that the water delivered is clean. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that our passive cooling solution would not lead to an increased risk of water contamination, such that any alterations to the enclosed clean water delivery is not made. Since evaporation cooling uses water for cooling purposes, the efficiency of rate of water evaporation to temperature drop achieved is also investigated to ensure that the use of water is as efficient as possible.<br />

## Goal 8: Sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions that allow people to have quality jobs

<br />
Work opportunities could be introduced through locally manufactured parts and manufacturing of the kiosk. Thus, considerations were made to avoid adding too much complexity in assembly due to the inculsion of the cooling solution and to use locally availabile parts if possible.<br />

## Goal 9: Investments in infrastructure are crucial to achieving sustainable development

</p>
<br />
Improvement in infrastructure is also addressed. With the inclusion of our cooling system, we are improving the quality of the end products from the water dispensers. Yet, it would be key to ensure that the cooling solution is resilient to the operating environments and durable. Sustainability considerations were also made as it is envisioned that the passive cooling solution could run on the solar panels installed on the kiosks without needing any external power supplies.<br />

## Goal 12: Responsible Production and Consumption

</p>
<br />
Sustainable consumptions is also promoted through our solution. With the use of the passive cooling soluion, the temperature drop of water could be achieved in an energy efficient means compared to refrigirating or other cooling methods, and would help further alleviate bottled water consumption as it allows for the water dispensers to be competitive with refrigirated bottled water. Cooling pad materials could also be recycled from waste clothes which help reduce waste production.<br />
