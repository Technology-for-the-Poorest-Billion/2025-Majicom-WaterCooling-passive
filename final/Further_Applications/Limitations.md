# Limitations

Several parameters relating to the real world effectiveness which may lead to discrepancies to the experimental findings, or are unable to be demonstrated by the experiments have been identified. xxx

## Relative humidity

The relative humidity varies greatly across wet and dry seasons in Tanzania, averaging at around 70% for the wet season. While we are able to demonstrate its cooling effectiveness in lower relative humidities, the real-life impacts of the increase in humidity is not well understood, especially the evaporative cooling performances is known to drop signifiantly at around 70% relative humidity. Therefore, it is recommended that further tests to be conducted in environments that simulate the conditions of wet seasons for proof-of-concept.
