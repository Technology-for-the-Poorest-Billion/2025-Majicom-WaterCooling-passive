# Limitations

Several parameters relating to the real world effectiveness which may lead to discrepancies to the experimental findings, or are unable to be demonstrated by the experiments have been identified. xxx

## Relative humidity

The relative humidity varies  across wet and dry seasons in Tanzania, with most months over 70% for the wet season. While we are able to demonstrate its cooling effectiveness in lower relative humidities, the real-life impacts of the increase in humidity is not well understood, especially the evaporative cooling performances is known to drop signifiantly at around 70% relative humidity. Therefore, it is recommended that further tests to be conducted in environments that simulate the conditions of wet seasons for proof-of-concept.

## Wetting mechanism

Water is applied evenly along the surface for our experiment. However, depending on how the evaporative surface is being wetted, the non-uniform distribution of water along the evaporative surface may lead to deviations.

## Fan placement

Due to the ratio of the size of the fan to the container for our experimental set-up, it was not possible for us to experiment with different locations of the fan. However, it would be key to induce a circular airflow around the inside of the evaporation chamber.
