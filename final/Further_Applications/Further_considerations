# Further Considerations

Several areas where it may face challenges in real life operations or could be modified for different optimizations are discussed below/

## Air intake

To achieve evaporative cooling, airflow is induced in the interior space of the water dispenser which acts as an evaporative chamber.

## Material degradation

## Fault diagonosis

how check if fault? fail-safe?
