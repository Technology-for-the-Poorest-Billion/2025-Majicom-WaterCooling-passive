# Operational Risks

Several areas where it may face challenges in real life operations are discussed below.

## Air intake

To achieve evaporative cooling, airflow is induced in the interior space of the water dispenser which acts as an evaporative chamber. However, it is predicted that dust particles may accumulate quickly inside the chamber given its outdoor location. Not only will dust lead to a decrease the rate of evaporation due to a reduction in surface area of evaporative layer, it may also lead to damages or premature wear of the fan or other internal components. It is expected that this will pose an even greater hazard for areas closer to deserts or with more barren land, where there is a higher concentration of sand and dust particles in the air.

Solution: Avoiding mounting intake fan close to the ground may reduce the amount of accumulated dust particles. Moreover, air intake filters could help block off most dust particles but will need to be replaced periodically. 


## Material degradation

Linen or similar materials may be weakened, shrink or even gradually decompose under prolonged exposure to water and high humidity environments. A musty smell or even molds may even develop under inadequate ventilation, posing potential health and safety risks. While theoretical effects could be estimated, it may be difficult to understand its long-term implications.
