# Material Selection

While linen has been identified as the most suitable material from experiments, there are multiple materials similar to linen and are suitable for real-life applications. The details are discussed below:

## Recycled clothes

Fabric composition: variable (including cotton, linen, silk or other synthetic fabrics)

Price: £0.13 per kg from texile banks

Main benefits: Being locally available, at a much cheaper price and contributing towards sustainable development goals 

Potential concerns: Hygene/ processing required, unknown durability (may need fixing or replacing within service life), inferior evaporation rates.

## Evaporative fabric

Dedicated fabrics designed specifically to facilitate evaporative cooling.

Fabric composition: 100% polyester

Price: £8.67 per metre square or £57.8 per kg

Main benefits: Polyester fabrics are hydrophobic and does not absorb too much water. Instead, moisture is being wicked to the surface of the material. This meant that it has a poor water retention but a high evaporation rate. It also has good wear resistance and could last very long.

Downsides: Cost, environmental harms (being non-biodegradable)
